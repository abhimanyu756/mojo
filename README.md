**Event:** Odoo X NMIT Hackathon Project

## Project Overview

### Overall Vision
The overarching vision for EcoFinds is to create a vibrant and trusted platform that revolutionizes the way people buy and sell pre-owned goods. It aims to foster a culture of sustainability by extending the lifecycle of products, reducing waste, and providing an accessible and convenient alternative to purchasing new items. EcoFinds envisions becoming the go-to destination for a conscious community seeking unique finds and responsible consumption.

### Mission
The mission for the hackathon team is to develop a user-friendly and engaging desktop and mobile application that serves as a central hub for buying and selling second-hand items. EcoFinds should leverage intuitive design and essential features to connect buyers and sellers efficiently, promoting a circular economy and making sustainable choices easier for everyone. This involves building a platform that is both functional and inspires trust and community.

## Problem Statement

**Challenge:** "EcoFinds â€“ Empowering Sustainable Consumption through a Second-Hand Marketplace"

Develop a foundational version of EcoFinds, focusing on core user authentication and product listing functionalities. Teams must deliver a functional prototype, accessible via both mobile and desktop interfaces, that allows users to register and log in, create and manage basic product listings (including title, description, category, price, and at least one image placeholder), and browse these listings with basic filtering and search capabilities. The system must employ efficient data structures for managing user and product data, ensuring a stable and responsive user experience.
